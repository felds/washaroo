Washaroo
========

A friendlier way to sort laundry.

Made by me for myself as a way to practice my React chops, so expect things to break.


To-dos
------

* [ ] When adding something with the same name, increment item count
* [ ] Validate against negative count
* [ ] Remove item when trying to decrement count and count is 0


Nice-to-haves
-------------

* Add an option to lock a list
* Sync with firebase
* Upgrade behavior to renderless components
* Build to iOS
